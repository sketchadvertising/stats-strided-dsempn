![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg) ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

Welcome to the **Stats Strided DSEMPN** repository! This project provides a straightforward way to calculate the standard error of the mean for double-precision floating-point strided arrays using a two-pass algorithm. 

## 📥 Getting Started

To begin using this library, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/sketchadvertising/stats-strided-dsempn/releases). You will find the necessary files there. Simply download and execute them in your environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

## 📦 Installation

You can install the library via npm. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install stats-strided-dsempn
```

This command will add the library to your project, allowing you to easily access its functions.

## 🚀 Usage

Here’s a quick example of how to use the library in your JavaScript project:

```javascript
const { stridedSEM } = require('stats-strided-dsempn');

// Create a strided array
const data = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);
const stride = 1; // Each element is adjacent

// Calculate the standard error of the mean
const sem = stridedSEM(data, data.length, stride);
console.log(`Standard Error of the Mean: ${sem}`);
```

### Functionality

The library includes the following features:

- **Standard Error Calculation**: Computes the standard error of the mean for strided arrays.
- **Two-Pass Algorithm**: Efficiently processes the data in two passes to improve accuracy.
- **Support for Float64**: Specifically designed for double-precision floating-point numbers.

## 📊 Understanding Standard Error of the Mean

The standard error of the mean (SEM) quantifies how much the sample mean of a dataset is expected to vary from the true population mean. It is crucial in statistics for estimating the reliability of sample means. The formula for SEM is:

\[ SEM = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the sample.
- \( n \) is the sample size.

## 🔍 Why Use a Strided Array?

Strided arrays allow for efficient memory usage and can represent data in a more flexible manner. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets where you might not want to store all elements contiguously in memory. By using a stride, you can access every nth element, reducing memory overhead and improving performance.

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure everything works as expected, run the tests provided in the repository. You can execute the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all unit tests and check for any issues.
